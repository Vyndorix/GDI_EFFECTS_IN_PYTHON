# GDI_EFFECTS_IN_PYTHON
Gdi effects in python. Its only for Windows ofc and Im on linux and if this works it deserves a Star tbh.
Inside the file it tells you what you need to do and blah blah blah and should work your just not supposed
to Copy and Paste this into your ide and run it your meant to take it one at a time and have fun with it,
it's 100% harmless by the way.
